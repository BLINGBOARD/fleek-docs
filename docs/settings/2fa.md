Fleek’s **2-factor authentication** setting will help you protect your account with a secondary layer of verification by associating a **phone number to your Fleek Account.** 

Each time you log in, you will receive a **2FA confirmation code to that associated phone number** that you’ll need to enter during your login, aside from your password.

> Alternatively, if you use **GitHub as your one-click login option for Fleek**, you can activate 2FA in your **GitHub account itself** and gain the same security benefits, but applied through the GitHub service.

## Setting up 2-factor authentication in Fleek

To get started, visit your **account's settings,** by clicking on the bottom left account name on the Fleek app.

If you haven't set up 2FA yet, you'll see this disabled. Click **set up 2FA to get started.** You will need to verify your account's emails if you haven't done so yet.

**Fleek will send you a verification email** to your associated account, make sure you visit your inbox and click the URL to verify your account's address.

Once you have, you can **go back to your settings page and click Set Up 2FA again.** This time, you'll be able to enter **a phone number.** Select the phone number's issuance country first. **Make sure this is a number you have access to** since you'll need to review its SMS messages to activate 2FA and, in the future, receive the codes to log into Fleek.

Once you enter a number, **Fleek will send an SMS with a 2FA verification code.** Enter it in the Fleek app to complete the 2FA setup.

**That is all! If the code is correct**, you will that 2FA will be now activated on your account. You'll receive a **confirmation email**, where you can also revoke the 2FA setup as well and disable it if you want to.

### Logging in with 2FA

How different is the experience when logging into your Fleek account when 2FA is activated? **Only one extra step.**

You will need to log into your account with your credentials, as always.

The only difference is that, **after entering your credentials,** you will need to enter **a 2FA code that you will receive to the associated phone number.**

Enter the correct code, and you'll be logged into Fleek as always. An extra layer of security goes a long way to secure your account, with a minor effort involved.
